# Commit Instructions

You're now ready to commit your changes to the CudaRL-Arena project. Here are the steps to follow:

## 1. Stage your changes

```bash
# Add all new files
git add .gitignore CHANGELOG.md CONTRIBUTING.md
git add python/cudarl/mock_env.py run_training.py
git add src/environment_bridge.cu src/environment_bridge.h
git add src/kernels.cu src/kernels.cuh
git add src/python_bindings.cpp src/q_learning.cu src/q_learning.cuh
git add src/train.py src/visualize.py

# Add modified files
git add CMakeLists.txt README.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md docs/README.md src/main.cu
```

## 2. Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Implement environment-agent integration and training loop"
```

## 3. Push your changes

```bash
git push origin aftermvp
```

## What's been done

1. **Environment-Agent Integration**:
   - Created a bridge between C++ and Python with `environment_bridge.h/cu`
   - Added Python bindings with `python_bindings.cpp`
   - Updated CMakeLists.txt with robust pybind11 detection

2. **Complete Training Loop**:
   - Implemented a full training loop in `train.py`
   - Added a mock environment for testing without CUDA
   - Created a wrapper script `run_training.py`

3. **Enhanced Environment Features**:
   - Added support for obstacles, goals, and traps
   - Improved reward structure
   - Better state representation

4. **CUDA-Accelerated Q-Learning**:
   - Added GPU acceleration with `q_learning.cuh/cu`
   - Implemented CUDA kernels in `kernels.cuh/cu`
   - Added batch processing for efficient learning

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - Created ARCHITECTURE.md explaining the project structure
   - Added CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
   - Added CHANGELOG.md to track project changes

The project now has a working training loop that can be run with a mock environment, and is ready for further development with CUDA acceleration.

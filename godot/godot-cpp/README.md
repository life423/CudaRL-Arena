# godot-cpp

This directory should contain the official Godot C++ bindings (godot-cpp) required for building GDExtension plugins.

To set up:
1. Download or clone the [godot-cpp repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) into this directory.
2. Follow the build instructions in the godot-cpp README to generate the static libraries and headers.

These bindings are required for building and linking the C++ GDExtension plugin (gd_cudarl).
